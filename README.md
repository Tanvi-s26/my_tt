- File Structure

timetable-app/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file
├── style.css           # All styling
├── script.js           # JavaScript functionality
└── README.md           # This file

- Quick Start

    Download the files (or clone the repo)

    Open index.html in your browser

    Start adding your classes - no setup needed!

That's it! Everything saves automatically in your browser.

- Why I Built This

- I tried several timetable apps but they were either:

    Too complicated with unnecessary features

    Required accounts/logins

    Didn't work offline

    Looked ugly


So I made this simple version that just works.
